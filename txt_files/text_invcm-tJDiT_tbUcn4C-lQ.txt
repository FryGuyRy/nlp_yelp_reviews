order the 3.99 ready pizza to and it was very good. it took 30seconds in and out and the peperoni pizza was very good. I will return.笑
Customer service sucks 
Pizza is really good
Better than Pizza Hut and they have good deals笑
Cant beat $4.00 pizza. It is really good for the prize. My husband likes it more than little Caesars and my brother likes it way more than hungry howies. Best of all, no waiting in line, you just walk in and pick it up. Not the best pizza in town but again, what do you expect for $4.00?笑
You can't beat pizza patron. The price is amazing and the pizza is good. How do you beat a 3.99 pizza? Also taste great. Why buy a 20$ pizza from someone else when this one is just as good. I always go there.笑
We picked this place based on good reviews. Don't trust the good reviews!! It was the most under-whelming pizza experience ever. The Mexicana was gross!! Fake weird chorizo. The Hawaiian was ok. We added jalapeños which made it slightly better. And we took one bite of the bread sticks and threw them away.笑
Pizza is really good better then little ceasers . Wait area is clean friendly service.
