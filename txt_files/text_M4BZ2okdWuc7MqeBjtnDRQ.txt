I visited this location on two separate occasions and both times were absolutely horrible. The place is disgusting and the workers don't seem to care. The first time my boyfriend and I went we waited almost a half hour FOR TWO BLIZZARDS. Their way of apologizing was offering us two expired coupons. The next time I went by myself to see if maybe it was just an off day for them. Nope. The place was still filthy and my ice cream tasted spoiled. I will never return to this location. Such a shame because I love Dairy Queen.笑
I went to this location on a busy Saturday. They were not accepting credit cards. I came back on Monday following for an apple pie blizzard. Guess what: STILL not accepting credit cards. Give me a break. Do you pay the lease at your establishment to turn away at least 60% of your business? Get out of here. I used to visit this location bc of how nice it was finished and great service, however there are at least 5 DQ's in Monroeville I can choose from. Bye-bye!笑
Stopped in for a quick cone for the kiddo. No adults in sight, and the clatch of teenaged girls and one boy were busy ignoring us initially (we were the only customers in line). Finally got the order, and somehow they were able to screw up a simple chocolate dipped cone. Hold it in the hot sauce long enough and yep - the ice cream inside melts and makes an immediate mess. We took it to go, and it got tossed in less than 5 minutes. 
Ugh...good job, owner or manager. Staff the place with kids that couldn't care less.
