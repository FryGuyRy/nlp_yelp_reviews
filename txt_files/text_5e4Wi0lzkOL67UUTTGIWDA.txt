This is the best place by far for lebanese food. Its fresh and cooked perfectly.

The portion are very big but if you take it to go it seems you get more than if you eat on site. 

Price are very good and the staff is amazingly friendly and helpful.

I go once a week and I never found anything to complain about. They also have a loyalty card.

They take credit cards and debit they have lots of room inside and outside笑
Un accueil irréprochable, des produits de qualités, des portions copieuses, le tout pour un prix raisonnable. Une excellente adresse. Lors de mon prochain passage a Montréal, je ferais le détour sans faute. Bravo笑
This is the best Lebanese food in town by far. The chicken and hummus are to die for. The shawarma is juicy and everything is fresh!! Yummy!!
