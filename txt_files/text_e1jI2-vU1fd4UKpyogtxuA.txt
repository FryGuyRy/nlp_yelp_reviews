Stopped in for a quick lunch with a friend. Clean and nicely appointed new cafe in The Junction. Reached for my Aeroplan Gold card a few times subconsciously. Where else besides an airport can you be overcharged for bland food ? And $3 plus tax and tip for a small cup of coffee ? I wish the owner well, but I probably won't be back.  Strange mix of self service and scrambly table service.笑
Went in to enjoy a coffee but instead had to sit there listening to the owner have a conversation about how uncivilized places like India are and how they don't meet her standards of travel (I'm Indian)   Keep your ignorant comments in your head and let your customers enjoy their coffee in peace.笑
I've stopped twice at this place, once for an iced coffee and once for lunch. The coffee was great and the owner was so friendly that I decided to come back with my Mom for lunch when I was in the area another day. We had the detox tea, the tuna melt and the lentil salad. It was all fantastic! We cannot wait to go back and try the Argentinian empanadas.
