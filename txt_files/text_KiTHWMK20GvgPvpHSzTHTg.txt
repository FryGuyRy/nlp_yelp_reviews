You are probably already addicted to this healthy fast food choice with a great concept and pricing. If you traveled from cali, you are most certainly spoiled to find it wherever you go, but once you hit the strip, its damn hard to find a chip!

Until now Chipotle fanatics been hustling and constrained to the one location on strip, squeezed right in between Harrahs and Casino Royale. But time has come, a brand new location just opened in Miracle Mile Shops in Planet Hollywood where you can have your favorite meal in a brown recyclable paper bag. You can sit inside or at one of their tables in the shopping mall. Same old stories, no surprises.

So why would you go to Vegas and eat the usual stuff? 
First: Its fast and damn good (Time is vital in Vegas)
Secondly: Its a cheap meat with high quality food (Last longer)
Thirdly: Because you dont always have the mood to go fancy (Rough night?)笑
I am a local who loves and goes to Chipotle at every city I visit. Today people here simply amazed me! The food here is always fresh and prepared to its best condition. Once again, I wanted to thank those people who work there. I'll be back soon :)笑
It's about time chipotle arrives at the strip! Awesome service awesome food. Still as good as any regular chipotle. Def get the chips and guac笑
Located inside Planet Hollywood. Seating is limited, so we had to sit outside. The veggie and chicken burrito bowls were standard. I always get the free guacamole with the veggie burrito bowl.笑
Normally, the Chipotle employees at other locations are vibrant and full of life.  However, at this one, they are more like mindless robots.  Two of them were yawning while filling people's burrito bowls.   I understand their pain though.  It was so busy that I can only imagine how tired they must have been.

When it was my turn, I tried to put on a smile, and the employee who helped me smiled back.  I made a difference in someone's life today!  

The food tasted like any other Chipotle.  The portions were huge.  I do not think they realize how much stuff they piled onto the bowl. Haha.笑
Exactly what you'd expect from Chipotle. Limited but sufficient seating, probably not for groups of more than 6. Some more tables out in the mall, too. Staff is happy to give extra of ingredients, etc. Can be long line at meal times.笑
Both of us got food poisening at this location. Don't know why people give great ratings for a ton of rice and beans with a couple of cubes of meat.笑
I wanted some rice and beans, so I stopped by Chipotle. This is your typical Chipotle joint. I ordered the burrito bowl. They filled my bowl up as I requested. All Chipotles I've been to have been the same. It makes a cheap, quick, and easy meal. I always walk out with lots of food compared to other places. I'm never left hungry for sure at Chipotle. I'm not sure if I'll come back to this location.笑
This is by far one of the smallest Chipotle that I've ever been too, but granted, space is most likely at a high premium. 

Seating:

The are a few tables, as well seats that line the store window. There is additional seating outside in the walkway of the mall that provides a less cramped environment

Food:

Standard Chipotle Menu

Price: 

One of the cheaper and filling options in Vegas for a meal, especially for Gluten Free

Wait:

Expect a line out the door, but it can move quickly, as long as the person in front of you is paying attention or knows what is going on笑
I got two chicken tacos and as I was eating them I noticed that the chicken wasn't cooked all the way! It was disgusting! I went to show the cashier and she asked if I wanted more or a refund and of course I wanted my money back and all she did was yell refund. Then a manager came up and she said oh she said it isn't cooked enough. And the manager refunded my money. But I had to remind them that they are supposed to have some sort of customer service and apologize! I will never go hwre again.笑
It was my first time checking out this place and it was delicious ! Well seasoning and flavorful food. I will miss this place a lot since we don't have it in Hawaii .笑
Worst chipotle, these ladies hated their jobs easily. I asked for a chicken burrito with everything and it had to be the smallest burrito I have ever seen. Everyone with me thought theirs were the smallest burritos too so I'm not just crazy. Just go next door to Panda Express.笑
Usually like this place but my last time here I ended up with sharpie writing on my burrito.笑
Crowded and limited space.
Nice location inside planet Hollywood in the Las Vegas strip.笑
I'm not a big corporate restaurant fan but currently my daughter is hooked on Chipotle. I ate the kids combo leftovers and they were pretty darn good. The wife only ate half her salad and I really enjoyed those leftovers too, not bad at all. If you are looking for a quick and reasonably priced meal I would highly recommend eating here.笑
Considering it's on the strip and great prices great value and they always have awesome food笑
Bleh. Tastes like the McDonald's of Mexican food.笑
This place was not bad at all with it being inside a mall. It was super crowded but I'm glad I was able to get a seat since the place was pretty small. There were tables outside as well but were also taken.

If you're looking for a cheap place to eat in Vegas, I guess this will be one of them! Looks like the prices are not raised and so it's a good option. And the food is consistent as well.

I recommend here for a under $10 lunch. Just beware of the huge crowds.笑
Within about 3 minutes of leaving this location my bag ripped from the bottom and my food splattered everywhere. Turns out the bottom of my bag was completely soaked, because I'm guessing my bowl wasn't sealed all the way so sure enough catastrophe ensued. I took a photo and my receipt back and asked if there was a manager on duty that I could speak with about how to proceed. The cashier just told the original employee that made my bowl to remake it. She did so with a surprisingly light hand, and then didn't give me a new bag of the $1 kids chips I ordered, because apparently even though the bag was soaked, it didn't actually rip so she couldn't give me another bag. Those chips are literally worth about 5¢ so I don't understand the big deal, I paid for them but apparently that was not enough. I didn't want to argue with her over a bag of like 12 chips so I just left. Bottom line: The chip thing should not be a big deal to me, but it unfortunately rubbed me the wrong way. The experience was infuriating and I will avoid this location in the future.笑
As if I could find a negative thing to say about Chipotle. This location in particular only lacks that they get bombarded by guests and If I don't time it properly between my lunch break I have to swing by somewhere else for lunch. Like any Chipotle you go through the line picking out what goes and what doesn't. I've noticed here they are very punctual about keeping the supply fresh. They're not conservative about how much they give you, if you feel jaded by the amount simply ask for a tad more. I find talking to them like a person and saying "thanks" will get you what you want sooner than a complaint. The biggest highlight here may be that there's no off the strip type premium charge for their food. They're no more expensive here than any Chipotle I've been to anywhere else and I'm really glad considering even the near by Subway deal is $8 foot longs. The place is a bit small maybe but they do offer additional seating just outside the store. I've personally had nothing but good experiences with the staff and that's a big part of why I'd come back and take the time to write a review. Keep it up Chipotle.笑
They are fast and friendly.
Personally Chipotle is not my favorite but they ware good.笑
Chipotle is absolutely my favorite fast food restaurant but I do however have to give this location a 4 instead of 5 because the employees there didn't really listen to customers when preparing their food. It was almost as if they anticipated what people were going to say and ended up putting the wrong things on the burrito. 

Also, there scanner was not working for the mobile chiptopia cards. I had to read out the long number to the person at the register twice instead of the quick scan that I am used to. If you are a chiptopia rewards card member I would suggest having the actual card with you instead of the mobile one.笑
damn as usual, Not enough meat! why chipotle you gotta be so cheap when i don't get rice and beans and you charge $10 for a damn burrito and $2.00 for damn guacamole!?

flavors were actually not that bad considering i don't go to chipotle unless i have a coupon for a free burrito or when a group, like this time, wants to go

i had the steak wit veggies, corn salsa, guacamole, green salsa, sour cream and it was not too bad, just the cheapo putting my steak on was too cheap, that made me upset! 
and before you ask why i didn't ask for more, they charge for extra scoops !笑
I admit I love Chipotle and now I love this location at Planet Hollywood too.笑
I have been to chipotles all over California (Bay Area and Southern California) and in and around the Las Vegas area and this is the only chipotle that gives you BELOW mediocre service. I have never any issues with chipotle till this one and MAN are these people STINGY as $&@?! When they give out food in anything. I have gone there 3 times at 3 different times of the day (opening, mid day, and lunch), with different people helping me and hoping it would be different. Sad to say it was the same thing. Barely any meat or anything at that in my bowl or burrito. The chipotles at Sarah/S Fort Apachie Rd AND E Haron/S Maryland have far better customer service and are very generous when it comes to putting food in their bowls/burrito. Such sad multiple experiences for a place I used to speak highly of.笑
Shortage no guac never heard such a thing. Ordered a salad and got more beans than salad. I can't even compare this place to any other chipotle I've been to. Not happy at all don't come here.笑
In Ph miracle mile shops// I frequent here when I'm in town, I wish every chipoltle was this good at being a chipoltle. !笑
A ray of light in a fog of way overpriced, arguably unhealthy food for blocks.

Chipotle usually gets 3 stars from me. It's reliable, does the fill-the-tummy trick, and I salute them for their sustainability chops, considering the chain's footprint, at this stage. But it's Chipotle. Not a mom and/or pop. And there's like not a whole lot of variation in the flavors you can get, when you go there; I usually get the same thing. Every. Time. But in Lost Wages, Chipotle is different. Even magical. 

I needed food. Preferably vegetarian, less than $20 for an entree, and within walking distance from Paris Las Vegas. I searched Yelp for an hour. Resigned myself to eat at the closest $$ Asian place, even though it didn't have very many vegetarian options (though the menu did say to ask, but I digress). But then, the clouds parted, and there was Chipotle.

At home in LA (that's Los Angeles for the tourists, not Louisiana), I eat Chipotle as a last resort. Here, it's a first resort amidst the panoply of resorts. That's a lot of resorts. 

There was a line. At 10:20 pm. There was a line when I left. Not longer than a lunchtime line at any busy Chipotle. You know the one. It moved quickly enough. I caught up on social media, as I wanted to avoid thinking about all of the awkward, as I stood in line by myself. 

One thing I was surprised not to have learned before: sofritos counts as a "protein," so even if you get a smidge of sofritos, like I do because in larger quantities they invariably give me acid reflux, guacamole is extra! Go ahead, take my money. 

But, Chipotle, your experiment to get people to eat tofu at an American quick food chain is going to fail, if you make people choose between guac and sofritos. Just telling it like it is.笑
Yeah, there's a bunch of other Mexican restaurants in Vegas.  But this one is just convenient being inside Miracle Mile at Planet Hollywood.

Came in and there wasn't a line.  Got a steak bowl, guac on the side and some chips.  A bit pricey, but that's Chipotle everywhere.  Their prices are increasing.  Price you pay for farm-fresh food or whatever Chipotle buys without the extra bad stuff.

Really small dining area inside, but there are tables outside.  It's a great little meal if you're in a rush and get some food down before you do Vegas things like drink.笑
I recently visited Las Vegas and went to this Chipotle for dinner one night. When I went to pay, my credit card was declined. I didn't have any other way to pay for my food, as I had left my other cards in my hotel room. The Chipotle staff handled the situation very kindly and professionally. Thank you Chipotle staff for turning a terrible situation into a great experience.  =)
