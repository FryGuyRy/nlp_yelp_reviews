Love Jimmy Johns!  Made my sandwich exactly as ordered, fresh with quality ingredients.  Super friendly staff and manager!笑
Newly Opened Location with a GREAT staff who is working hard to be FREAKY FAST!!!! I would highly recommend this location given the cleanliness and quality of product!!!!笑
Of all the Jimmy John's I have been to, this one was the best tasting.  I'm so happy that there is a Jimmy John's on Brunswick! My delivery driver was very friendly also. Keep him on board!笑
Friends brought Jimmy Johns box of little sandwiches (whatever you call that choice) to a Chrismtas party.  It was amazing.  The subs went faster than the deviled eggs.  They tasted great and were so easy for my friends (She hates cooking!)  Will definitely remember that the next time I'm invited to a party and need to bring a dish to pass
