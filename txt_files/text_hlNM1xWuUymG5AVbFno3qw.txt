We need to work on our food business here, Wendy's (on Sharon Amity Rd. in Charlotte, NC). Maybe it was just a bad day for the employees but the entire ordering process was slow. Not because the line was backed but there was an inadequacy about the entire process, from ordering the food, to getting the food. The cashier seemed new or not adequately trained, countless food and drink orders were long, the time to get the food for each customer while I was there was very slow. This is not an patient/impatient thing, this was just, well, slow and many of the food orders were slow to get filled and they were very incorrect on top of that. They did seemed very well, adequately staffed so I am unsure as to what the problem is or if this is/was a 1 time fluke.笑
I give this Wendy's  4 stars Don't judge the quality due to the location. The food was hot and fresh and everything in my order was correct. The service was fast and not slow at all like some if the other Wendy's I have been to in the area. My burger even looked like the actual photo and not smashed buns. I gave it 4 stars because some of the tables should have been wiped off笑
I don't understand how so many people work here without actually doing any work. The line is often wrapped around the building and no one seems to have any interest in doing their job. Don't waste your time coming here. It's a headache everything and there's nothing "fast" about it. I'm not sure who manages this location but it's not up to par.
