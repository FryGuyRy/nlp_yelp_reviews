Rude ass mouthy ass manager messed up my order and when I called to complain she had so much attitude. I'm a person of action so I went back to get my correct order and to make sure this bitch wanted to say all the slick shit she had to say on the phone, to my face. She had nothing but stank ass attitude no edges and a flat ass. Never coming here again. Worst customer service ever.笑
I use to love Burger King but these one really killed it for me order a whopper and smelled n tasted like it was burned was nasty笑
Rude mouthy manager taking orders and refusing to give food useless I give him a tip and can't get a simple order current.... 1st,  off this dude should a manager if he can't even have proper customers service. 2nd, sense when does Burger King ask there customers for tips let alone with hold a customer food after already paying for and demanding a tip not only once but twice cause I was only given half my food. Seriously this dude needs to be fired...笑
This "restaurant" never gets my order correct.  This morning, I ordered two bacon croissantwiches and got one bacon and one sausage.  What a load of shit!笑
I love you, Burger King. Fast food and I have a love-hate relationship. However, today, Burger is the love of my life because I could feed my children on the fly. After chowing down on a lunch date with hubby and daughter number two, I was stumped on what to feed son and daughter number one plus boyfriend. Burger King to the rescue. Driving on our way home, we picked up 3 orders of $1.49 for 10 nuggets with barbecue, ranch and honey mustard sauces plus 2 hamburgers with only ketchup. Our grand bill of $7 plus change. Thanks for being there for me, Burger King. Love, Kemlyn.笑
I found a fly in my chicken sandwich. I returned my whole meal for a full refund. The staff didn't seem too concerned about it.
