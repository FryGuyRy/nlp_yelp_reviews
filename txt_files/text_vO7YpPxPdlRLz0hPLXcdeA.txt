Hendersons on Holyrood Road has had a mini makeover so some comfy booths and high tables in addition to friendly staff and a fair range of sit in and takeaway lunch options. It was however worryingly empty bang on 1pm on a week day. The weektime crowd are mainly workers so speed and price (which their predecessors were maybe lacking) as well as good food are key. It's an airy, bright venue and Hendersons has a longstanding reputation in the city so hoping the combo works out as there's not a lot of options near by.笑
Hendersons is fine. The mismatched colourful furniture and decor is interesting, and it has lots of windows and natural light. The service is a bit slow and the tables aren't always cleaned as quickly as they should be. It's also annoying that the coffee prices listed above the bar are takeaway prices, with no sit-in prices listed so it seems a bit like false advertising. £2.65 seemed like a lot for a cappuccino since it wasn't the best I've had and was disappointing. Overall this little place will do the trick though. The vegan and vegetarian food looked good but I haven't tried it.笑
V busy only 2 ladies taking the order and preparing the food, then serving.
They served the coffee immediately and after 20 min we got the food. (  coffee become cold)
Food was fresh & delicious, jam tasty. but it would be better if they hire more employee.笑
Friendly, inviting...
Worth skipping a day of meat...
Quick, good, really fast!!!
