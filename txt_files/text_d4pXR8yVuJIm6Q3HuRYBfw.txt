Heard their radio ad for buying a sub before 9am and receive a free small breakfast sub so I go there at 8:15am ...just minutes after hearing this radio ad and found out that this location does not open till 9am.

That is one way to keep the freebies given out to a minimum.

Did the Subway survey asking for email feedback from the manager and got crickets...

It is one thing to have a problem, but the customer is more likely to remember how it was (or was not) handled笑
Very friendly afternoon staff, clean dining area and clean restrooms. What more do you want besides a good sammich?!笑
Cheery guys working tonight.  All were courteous and helpful.  One wanted us to come back in a half hour to give us a coupon cuz he thought we were dissatisfied with service because register wasn't printing receipts and all I was wanting was an address so I could add them to Yelp.  ;-)
Unfortunately I was unable to make it back there cuz I had to take hubby some gas for his vehicle.

Oh, what I didn't like was the extremely loud, high pitched, door bell that sounds every time the door is opened.  Yeesh that was annoying.
Turn it down boys.
