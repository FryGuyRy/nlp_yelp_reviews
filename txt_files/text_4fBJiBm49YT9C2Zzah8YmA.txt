Stopped in here for breakfast on a whim. Wow! The food was so tasty and so clearly lovingly prepared. The presentation was delightful - finely cut pieces of fruit and fresh olives accompanied my bagel with lox. While I ordered a simple meal it was probably one of the best bagels with lox I've ever had. My friend loved his three cheese omelet, which looked fluffy and delicious.笑
Such a great place outside the famous Jean Talon marketplace.  You can eat outside or in.  Great food case showing off great sandwiches and deserts.  The menu unfortunately was not available in English but we pointed at some stuff.  I loved the great tea  sets. Had to order tea just to enjoy the pretty China.  Bright blue walls and simple decor gave this little cottage restaurant a great feel.  Very nice gentleman behind the counter also added to the charm.  The veggie sandwich and roast beef was delicious.  Came with a refreshing salad on the side with great mango slices and apples. Tasty vinaigrette dressing.  Overall very nice place笑
Enjoyable and adorable little cafe with a great design. The mixing of patterns and colors works well. We had a lovely Montreal style bagel and an apple pastry. We also had hot tea with superb presentation.
