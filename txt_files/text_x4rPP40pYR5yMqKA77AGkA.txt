Real carnitas! Cactus salad, rotisserie chicken; other than Mexico there's Catnitas Guanajuato. Authentic & extremely good! Nice people as well...笑
There are a lot of Mexican restaurants in Charlotte, but this is the only one I have found that has pork skin tacos. That's right, cracklins on a taco. It doesn't get much better than this. Crispy fried pork fat on a taco. Yum. Hubby had the BBQ lamb plate and all that was left at then end of the meal were some licked clean bones. 

They also offer "fruit waters" which are excellent. All they need is some rum to throw in the pina one and they would have a great Pina Colada.笑
Not closed- just moved to Albarmarle Road, in the shopping center where the Dollar Tree is near Sharon Amity.笑
This place is legit.  Best carnitas in town, without a doubt.  The refried beans are also excellent as is the guacamole!  Packaged all together inside the homemade corn tortilla and it is heaven.  Go there.笑
Carnitas Guanajuato has moved to 5534 Albemarle rd.
