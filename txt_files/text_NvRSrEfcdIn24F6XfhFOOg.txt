Not my fav Timmy's. The parking lot creates mass confusion. Who designs a parking lot where cars come in, and have to make a three-point turn to turn around to get out. It's one of the few Timmy's where cars don't have the ability to drive around the location. You drive in and get stuck in congestion as cars try and turn around to get out because they realize you can't drive forward. Terrible design! 

As for the location, I asked for a decaf tea with four sugars. The woman then asked if I wanted a double double with the decaf tea together. Seriously? Tough communication skills at this location. 

Meanwhile, once they get the order right, the tea and coffee tastes like all Timmy's and the bagels and pastry rival any other location. Just be prepared to wonder who the heck designed this terrible parking lot!笑
Always a must when I'm in Canada great Americano coffee to start your day. I always have a 10 pack of Timbits with my coffee.笑
This Tim's has an ultra long line up.  Like really really long.  

Although the staff were pleasant, they seemed to have difficulty with my order.  I ordered a green tea, black, with cold water at the top.

They may have more success with your order.  Double double, anyone?笑
Went through drive through...they managed to get the tea wrong again,.....gave me a coffee. 
I don't know why I bother to even ask for a tea anymore, as they seem to give me whatever they please.
At least the person who dealt with me (after I parked my car and went in) apologized, while the moron who was working the drive through window just looked at me.....笑
not a location I go to often, but its above average from a standard location, being attached to Vaughan mills makes it a bit of a zoo just to go into the "Vaughan Mills Centre" just to get a cup of coffee. having said that, the only knock against this location would be that sometimes the drive thru line-up seems to be never ending. the service is great though.
