Taylor was takin' the orders and fillin' 'em as quick as possible.  

I stopped on a Friday morning looking for a small something to eat while I traveled along the Ohio Turnpike.  A little something turned out to be a 3 piece meal of spicy chicken, with red beans and rice, and a biscuit. Whew - more than I wanted, but good to the last bite.

I recommend!笑
I can't believe I ate chicken from this place. You could tell the employees hated their jobs. The worst customer service.笑
Took almost half an hour between getting in line and receiving my food. The spicy tenders I ordered were dry/stale. Fries and biscuit were fine.笑
Stopped at the Plaza at 9:55 and ask the lady at the register if they were closed and she said YES and didn't mention the drive thru was open until 11pm.  Very rude and zero customer service.  Even said Yelp had the close time at 11pm and she didn't have a clue.笑
I don't remember Popeyes chicken tenders tasting that horrible! I ordered a 5 piece spicy chicken tenders. The chicken was dry and it was mostly breading, that was stale tasting. I would skip this Popeyes and try a different one!笑
Worst customer service an employee standing around thumb up his butt four people in line and can not get waited on GO SOMEWHERE ELSE笑
The chicken was okay. The rice in the red beans and rice was undercooked slightly. Not good. 
Worst of all the service was slow. Waited at least 20 minutes before ordering. Seems like there wasn't any coordination between the person taking orders and the workers in the back. The one person filling the orders seemed like she was lost. She was mixing up orders. The so-called supervisor was called to make corrections to the order receipts repeatedly. At least the guy taking orders kept his cool trying to take orders from the crush of people waiting in line. 
I should have kept on going to the next service plaza.
