Service is super fast and the place is clean. I'll take a Cousins over Subway any day. The soups are tasty and I like the bread for their sandwiches.笑
I used to go here all the time.  Great subs.  I wish they were a little close to me and I'd eat there several times a week.  Never go wrong with Cousins!笑
Great customer service on the phone and in person. Consistently tasty subs. Love this Cousins in Monona!笑
I'd go there more often if the prices were lower, but you get what you pay for.  This place puts Subway to shame.
