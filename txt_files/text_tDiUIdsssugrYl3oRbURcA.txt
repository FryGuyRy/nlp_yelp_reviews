chinese buffet restaurant,lovely food, eat as many puddings as you like, reasonably priced, always happy to accomodate large groups, fast service, very child and family freindly, early eavening/lunch time happy hour.笑
The food here is lovely and there is a wide selection available. I have never had a bad meal here. The prices are very good for the food and drinks. The only problem is they tables are very close together so you can't get much privacy. Staff are quick to clear empty plates and glasses.笑
We use this restaurant a lot as it is small but homely, it has a good choose of food that is always hot. The staff are always at hand to help and top up the food. I would tell anyone of the great service that you get there. A great night out. Price of the food for as much as you can eat is great.
