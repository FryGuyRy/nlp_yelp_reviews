I can't seem to order anything different! The menu options are endless but  I keep defaulting to the Lemon Pepper wings, salty, tangy, peppery and crisp.  And Hot.  And not enough!  I could eat a double order if it didn't mean double the price.  I find myself eating all of the accompanying carrot sticks and celery sticks (I hate celery) just to round out the meal.  I can't wait until they introduce a few "special wing deals" on which I can capitalize.

Service is always very friendly and attentive.  Go, have some wings and a brew!笑
This new location of the much-beloved Wild Wing franchise is just like all the others. Great wings, great beer, great service, EXCEPT when you call in orders for take-out. Whatever time they quote you, just add 20 minutes to it & you'll be fine. However, don't be surprised if even after all that time, they don't cook your food until you walk in the door. Every time I've ordered from this location, they have never had the food ready at the time quoted, and most of the time I can see them throw the wings / fries / what have you into the fryer when I go in and tell them my order. But the great, fresh, hot food is well worth the wait. Just don't expect timeliness, and you won't be disappointed. :-)笑
What else can I say, it's wings. Love the flavours.
