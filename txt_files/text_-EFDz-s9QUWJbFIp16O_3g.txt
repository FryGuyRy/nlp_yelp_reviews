a fairly new location, for this area, and the block of new stores that are around it! 
great service, great staff and a super clean location. 
this location makes shopping in this area a little less painful, cause we all need a bit of spring in our step.笑
This tim hortons is the worst I've ever been to. First things first, I took the time to walk there. I ordered a steeped tea only to get a coffee instead. And then ordered timbits only to find out they were stale. So I ended up walking back and switching the coffee to the tea... and got a refund for the timbits. No hassles.
But when I brought the tea back, I was told there was too much milk and the tea tasted like it wasn't fresh. 
Never again will I go to this tim hortons.笑
I was ignored by the cashier for over five minutes, she was talking to one of her friends and made eye contact with me multiple times.  She made no move to serve me, just ignored me. 
I was told when I was finally served that they had no timbits, of any type, available. They also had no soup. 
I got a toasted bagel that wasn't even toasted. 
Tim's is the only place within walking distance from work. Their customer service is horrible.
