A friend wanted to meet me downtown during the afternoon so we decided to meet at Eaton Center. He bought something to eat since it was relatively close to lunch but since I ate a late breakfast and wasn't really hungry, I opted to find a place where I could just get something to drink.

I decided to try out Bubble Tease. It is located in the Eaton Center's food court.

The drink I got was a bit pricey (my drink cost me $6.31) but I enjoyed it. I can't really complain about the service since it was okay or as to be expected.笑
Pretty good but super pricey for a mall bubble tea location. The tea is tasty, but I've had better for less money. I like the design of their booth and their cups, it's really cute.笑
On trouve Bubble Tease dans la halte bouffe sous le niveau métro. Perso, j'adore les bubble tea, mais je les trouve souvent trop sucrés et les formats sont gigantesques. Chez Bubble tease il y a un petit format (12-14 onces) et ça goûte le vrai thé vert frais! J'ai pris aux pêches et j'ai adoré!
