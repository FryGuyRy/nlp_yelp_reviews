Now honestly, I don't know how I feel about this meal. Was it nasty? No. It was just different. I'm a creature of habit and always order the same thing; chicken and broccoli with pork fried rice. A positive thing is that they use real chunks of white meat chicken. They don't use cornstarch in their "gravy", it wasn't thick at all, just a broth. This place was out the way, but I always drive by it and wanted to try it out. I don't think I will dry back for it. Nothing out of this world to convince me. They don't take cards only cash.笑
Family just moved to Charlotte. We decided to try take out for the first time. We searched several places via internet and Yelp and found the Golden Wok.

We called and the woman who took the order was quite polite and truly made sure she got the order right. We ordered Shrimp Chow Mein, beef and broccoli, shrimp fried rice, shrimp Lo Mein; we ordered them all in a 'Large'. She said it would be ready in 10 minutes, and sure enough it was ready when we arrived.

Things to note: 1. don't be fooled by the neighborhood, not in the best location for gentrified Charlotte, the good is great. 2. They are a CASH ONLY restaurant. 3. As a Chinese restaurant they DO NOT have chopsticks. 4. Take only.

The food was tasty but was a bit too greasy.

Ended up being enough to feed three adults and two small children.笑
Great sesame chicken and food...... Place has no seating tho and is a little unkempt. To go only! Ten minuteeeee
