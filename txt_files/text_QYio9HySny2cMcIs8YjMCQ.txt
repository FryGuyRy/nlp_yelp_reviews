Fast, fresh and delicious food at a good price point.  Clean restaurant and great service.笑
Yummy ethnic addition to downtown cleveland. They are open for breakfast and lunch and specialize in lebanese fare (think shwarmas, falafel) with a more diverse menu than expected including fresh baked treats. On opening day, they gave free samples of a numura cake which was deliciously moist and soaked in orange syrup.

I ordered the beef shwarma plate ($11) which comes with two sides. I got the lentil salad and fouttoush salad. The beef was tender and flavorful with a generous coating of middle eastern spices. The salads were also tasty despite being salads. The fouttoush salad was unique and they added crunchy crouton-like crackers on top which added a nice textural dimension.

Good food, friendly service. Will be back and most excited to get some namura cake!笑
So happy this awesome little place opened up right near me! Tried some grab and go food here. You can customize a platter for yourself that comes with a meat, rice, pickled turnips (yum) and two sides. I tried the chicken shwarma plate with fries and quinoa salad. The fries were insanely delicious. They come hot and crispy, and include some herb seasoning that you can sprinkle on as liberally as you like (I think it had sesame seeds and oregano?). Actually, everything I tried as delicious and the portions were definitely satisfying. 
I took my food to go but hey have small window seats where you can enjoy your meal. 
Only downside is that it's only open 7-3 on the weekdays and 7-2 on Sat for the working crowd. Great addition to the neighborhood!笑
Cute new spot on Huron Rd. In DT Cleveland. 
Nice folks and wonderful Lebanese food!
Great beef shawarma and falafel sandwiches. Perfect lemony hummus as well. Portions are generous.
