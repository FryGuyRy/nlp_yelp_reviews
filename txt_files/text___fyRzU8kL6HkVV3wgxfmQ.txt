Were  hiding from the rain  and  stumbled upon  this bar in the heart of the Mile End!  Laid  back  atmosphere where  people  are allowed to show  their music  skills  by playing  the instruments on the stage!  We were  here  for  over  an hour  and 2 dudes  went  on the stage  and were  somewhat  decent.  

We had few drinks  and were ready to chew on something  but  the barmaid  told  us that the  kitchen closes  at 8 and past that  they  only  have typical  sport menu... So  we've ordered  the chicken  wings  that  gave  us  more reason  to get more drinks!  Overall  very  happy!笑
Pretty nice venue. I wasn't offered a food or drink menu when I attended a show there during the Fringe festival, so I just ordered a Perrier (the bartender said she had only the standard non-alcoholic options: soft drinks or Perrier.) I enjoyed the Fringe show I saw and would've gone back, with friends this time, to see it again, but the venue cancelled the show at the last minute. As a performer who tries to support other local performers, I don't think I want to go back there. They used to bill themselves as a performance venue, but cancelling live acts is a show of bad faith. It's not like there aren't other bars, cafes, and restaurants in the neighborhood - heck, even on the same block. The next time I want to grab a drink and maybe hear some live music or see a show, I'll go elsewhere.笑
Tried  their  pulled pork  sliders  and these are  are  simple  yet one  of the  most delicious little  burgers  I have  ever  tried.  Enjoy  them  with  mozzarella  sticks for  maximum  appreciation! 

Their  poutine  was average  despite  the fact  that  waitress said  it was supposed  to be an amazing  one. 

I really  liked  their  decor  and  the interior  ambiance.  I am waiting  to visit  the place  at night  as they  are holding live  shows.
