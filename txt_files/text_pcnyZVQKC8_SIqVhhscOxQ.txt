Had fish sandwich platters with fries and slaw. Food was really good and fairly priced. Will definitely be back to try some other "non-lenten" food!笑
The wings are amazing.  Nice blue collar bar atmosphere.  Jamie is without a doubt the best bartender in Washington county.  Get go wrong with this bar!笑
Another great local bar in Canonsburg. Great wings, you control the amount of sauce that goes on them. NIce Blue Collar type place, friendly Bartender's. Jen is great, my cousin Michelle worked there for years, too, always loved it.笑
Excellent food and excellent people.  Beer is always cold and they have a big menu for a small local bar.  Food is always tremendous and extremely cheap!  I personally recommend the fish sandwich, Ruben, and the hot roast beef dinner is out of this world.  You won't go home hungry!笑
Great local bar. Good food, huge portions. Show up for a Pens or Steelers game and enjoy the show. The hot bartender with the tattoos doesn't hurt. Definitely on my go to list when I'm feeling divey.笑
I ordered a steak salad and it had a steak-um on it... I had to force myself to eat it because I didn't want to waste my money or make the waitress feel bad..笑
The broasted wings are pretty damn good.
