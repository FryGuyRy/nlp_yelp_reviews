I usually don't like ale's but the Winter spiced ale is good
Grilled chicken with spinach, portabello mushroom & rice pilaf tasty!笑
We work at a dealership in the automall and always order breakfast from the pub, there is always a sweet woman that answers the phone BUT today however this wasn't the case CONNIE was working and I am sad to say this will be the LAST time we order from this bar.. When calling in our order the woman on the phone was very unpleasant, I told her we had 4 different orders and she replied with "all on different tabs!?" I said yes, she responded with "yea ok let me see how to do this". The last order was just sourdough toast and she complained "ON ONE TAB?!" I said yes, or you can just add it to the first order. She took my order and we hung up.. THEN we had to call back and add another order and she was just as unpleasant to the person that called, responding with "next time can't you guys just call in ONE order on ONE tab, it's easier for the cook? In response he said, "what if you had 5 different customers come in?" Her response was "I'm just saying it's easier for the cook!" This is HORRIBLE customer service and this woman needs to realize how she is coming off to people by saying things like that. Obviously  she doesn't want our business or ANY business for that matter. If you get CONCEPCION on the phone or as a waitress hang up or walk out.笑
Went here for an after-work get together with the whole office and we all left to go to another bar because of the attitude from the bartenders here. One seemed like she was annoyed every time we asked for anything and the other was trying to cut perfectly sober people after 2-3 drinks. The food was plainly average, the happy hour drinks were a good price, but more than glad we left, will surely not be returning. Had much more fun elsewhere.笑
I only give a one because the door opened and toilet worked other than that ugh!!! Just because you change the name of the place it doesn't make it better! The tall guy with the go-t was a jerk. He stared at my friends boobs the whole conversation. And when my friend showed no interest in him he gave us horrible service. I have been there alone several times before they changed the name and it was fine now what a waste. And the same jerk worked there before too.笑
Ordered over the phone & picked up. Person who took our order was very nice. 

When we went & picked up, the 2 people at the bar were both helpful & got our food right away. We ordered Steak&Fried Shrimp and an Apple&Pecan Salad. Both tasted great. Only problem was that when we got home, I noticed the vinegarette  for my salad was forgotten, so I made my own. 

We would definitely go back. Friendly people. Good food. Not expensive.笑
Never real busy. Always been a good dinner. Nice for a weekday meal, nothing fancy, just a good dinner.笑
Great food and drinks at a good price. My bartender Lori took really great care of me. My country fried steak was delicious and huge portions! Had it as leftovers for lunch and it was still good. If you're looking for a chill place with good drinks and atmosphere, this is the best.笑
Every time I come here I have a great time! The food is actually really good- they even have healthy options! Not your typical Bar food. The drinks are strong and the bartenders are friendly but not too chatty. There are plenty of seats to gamble/or not - your choice- they aren't pushy about it like some bars. The bar is really really smoky though- very chill spot most people are here to just chill and watch a game on tv with a beer笑
The bartenders here are horrible. I had 2 drinks within 2 hours, and they decided to cut me off. The bartender replied that he did not know what else was going on with me. Not that it is any of his business, but I just got off work, and wanted to have a few drinks with my Co Workers.笑
A neighborhood bar that is a chain all over Vegas. This is the first Village pub that I've been to, so I'm not sure how it compares to others. We ate in the bar area at the tables, and were served by a really nice waitress. We ordered the chicken sandwich and the Philly cheesesteak dip. The cheesesteak was a little in the chewy side, but the au jus was pretty good. The chicken was a pretty standard grilled chicken breast, but the bread was really good. For about $10/entree and cheap drinks, I cant complain! We also played some video poker at the bar. They serve local Ellis Island beer on tap here and it's very affordable too!笑
The food here is the reason Village Pub is getting 3-stars. One of the main bartenders did not give my husband and I very good service. She only paid attention to the regulars and hardly asked us how we were doing. Waited with our empty plates for well over 10 minutes before she came back to us. She also made both of us feel incompetent when we asked for a different side because the one we received tasted funny. Not good customer service. We might return of we do not sit at the bar. My husband's steak and my wrap were very good. They only have their beers on tap, so be prepared for that though I've heard they are good.笑
Had the pleasure of grabbing a drink at the Village Pub while in Vegas. Our server Danny way the man!笑
Football food and drinks 
Wonderful meatball sliders
Robin is a wonderful bartender
1 place笑
Great locals hangout and open 24/7. Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner and numerous daily specials to select from.
We had breakfast this morning and the service was really good. I had the chicken fried chicken, eggs, toast and sweet potato tots.
Lana had steak and eggs. Everything was prepared promptly and fresh. Only slight drawback was the breading on my chicken fried chicken was a little overly salty and Lana said her steak lacked seasoning, so one item over salted and one item under seasoned, but still a great place for breakfast. We've dined here many times when it was Timbers and it was good and now as Village Pub it's even better. The fish and chips are a standard and the BBQ Ribs is something we'll try sometime soon.
Kind of an out of the way location, but try it out. It's never over crowded and the service is very good.
The man today in the black Chef's coat, Jon was a great host! He really cared about your comfort and was always checking on us.
Check out the specials on the blackboard it has some great values. Also happy hour 11pm to 3 am and 3pm to 6pm daily. Prices are great, but the happy hour prices makes it even better.
Our breakfast this morning, Chicken Fried Chicken, Steak and Eggs, with two coffees was $20 and change! I'll give you $20, go to the grocery store and try to recreate this breakfast, it can't be done.
Village Pub, 215 and Gibson/American Pacific in Henderson. Check them out anytime! 5 Stars!笑
Some of the best "bar food" around, the fish and chips, hot breaded wings and burgers are just awsome. Robyn is one of the best bartenders I have encountered, she is very attentive to all patrons.  Great job John , Robert , and Robyn笑
My boyfriend and I came in here July 17 around midnight. This bar was absolutely wonderful, my guy is big into bars and we were looking for a new place to try. This popped up on my yelp search, and what a joy it was to eat here. The waitress was great! She had such a welcoming personality, which it seems here in Vegas you don't find too often anymore, but she really gave us an inviting presence. I asked about food and she explained that the kitchen cooks up a storm and I explained my dietary concerns and she came up with the best recommendations and we ordered from there. The food was great, came out in a timely manner, and we were super pleased with everything we received. Thanks again guys, we will surely be back! :)笑
Danny is the man! We like to head there after work and he always gives us a great experience. It's the best customer service I've had at any bar. The food is good too, but the drink specials are great.笑

This restaurant has great food and prices!  WARNING: If your waitress is CONCEPTION DO NOT HAVE HER SERVE YOU!  She is loud, rude and puts the customer LAST. We went to eat there and when I asked her to put on the NBA PLAYOFFS she ignored me, but finally she  put the Game on when I was finished with my meal. Ask for another waitress or leave because the BITCH will do you wrong! Spend your valuable $$$$$ not with the WAITRESS FROM HELL!
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$笑
This place is not a gaming bar. It's more of a waiting room or a stall while you wait for a Chimichanga from Roberto's.笑
Horrible service we were literally sitting there for 20 min and not one person came or even acknowledged us and it was not busy what so ever. Never again with this place笑
The staff and service here are amazing! I ordered the fish tacos and they were super simple but delicious. The environment is calm and quiet. Even though they allow smoking you can't really smell it. The lighting is a bit dark me but your eyes a just so its not really that bad. All I can say is the staff really is amazing here?笑
Horrible service.  One waitress, are you serious.  Will never come back.

We came with a party of 8.  Restaurant unable to accommodate us to sit together.

Not impressed with the food.笑
My go to place for Steak & Eggs.
- $7.50 morning special (I think later in the day it's $10, still a bargain).
- Excellent happy hour that's $2.50 for well drink or draft beer.
- Great bartenders and staff.
- I go here 2+ times a month.笑
Bomb food. Great nfl games menu cheap and delicious. Happy hour great
Friendly atmosphere. I really enjoy coming here to kick back and have a drink. I recommend giving this place a shot. Lori the waitress was awesome always is笑
I used to love going here for the late night happy hour but they stopped doing that so I no longer go here.笑
Great service and great food. The server was very friendly and receptive. It is a great local hangout. If you want to just eat, you can go in the dining room ( to avoid the smoke). The bartenders are also very friendly and offer prompt service.笑
Great service here every time I come. Today, Robin was tending bar, and she was so friendly! She also made the best piña coladas. 

I highly recommend their potato skins--they're hot fresh and loaded with cheddar cheese, sour cream, chives, & bacon. Everything else I've had here was also delicious.

Great atmosphere--I love the sofas and flat screens on the back. There's also a separate dining area and free WiFi!
