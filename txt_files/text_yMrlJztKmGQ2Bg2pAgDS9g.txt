Keep driving....Don't stop... Awful food and horrible service.... Wendy's Corporate should shut them down!!!  Dave would be so sad if he knew.笑
You can really tell that Dave Thomas is dead.  Who the hell is running this company?  The double cheese burger I ordered was dryer than salted pretzels!  The big sales pitch was how moist the "never frozen" burgers were!!  It will be a Very long time before I'm going through that place again.笑
About the same as other locations.  You get what you expect.  it is fast food but good.  The do have a value menu and there are coupons in the entertainment books.  The fries and the frosty are good.笑
Horrible service at drive-thru. Crabby lady pretty much asks "what do you want?" Throws your bags at you at the window, like you interrupted her quiet time. No customer service skills whatsoever. I know it's fast food, but come on!

Will never go back.
