I love this place. they have never gotten an order wrong and have always been really nice to me. It is the closest papa johns to me and that's still a long drive so my pizza is never hot when i get it home and that will usually make a pizza taste bad but i have not had a bad pizza yet. its great food as a reasonable price笑
Their pizza is always hot & fresh.  I placed on online order last week and somehow when I went to pick it up I had 3 pizza's!  I showed the confirmation email & explained I hadn't hit complete button & I went back and edited my order.  Jay was kind enough to give me those 3 pizzas for the price of one instead of throwing them away.  I thanked him and apologized sincerely.

I will continue to do the business with them ..... it's the best pizza in my opinion!笑
I've noticed, over the past few months, a steady decline in the give-a-crap department. I understand being busy, but it would be nice to only have the toppings I request. I just found 10 mushroom pieces and 7 sausage pieces on my ham & pineapple. Please slow down & give a crap... Cross contamination is a serious thing.
