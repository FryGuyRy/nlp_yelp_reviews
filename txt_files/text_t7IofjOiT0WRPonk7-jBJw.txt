God mat, utrolig koselige lokaler og veldig bra beliggenhet. Spesielt om sommeren, også fint å sitte ute :-)笑
The pizza was ok..
They say its the American way... I think they should visit a few joints over here so they have something to compete with. 
Overall it was ok, nothing more nothing less.笑
It is definitely a must when in Horten , Norway  friendly staff always happy to suggest a personal favourite or local favourite on the menu. Cold Carlsberg Pilsner on tape well stocked bar and expresso machine round out this gem of a spot . If your looking for pizza pie this is where you'll start and end sporting 3 classics California , Chicago and New Yorker style pies .  Pictured is the Farmers Ham pizza delicious is an understanding two thumbs way up for this  pie establishment
