Haven't been here in a while but the service is still fast-paced and the people are really nice. 

Ordering Halibut and poutine was awesome, they arn't chincy with the cheese and dont drown the fries in gravy.. good stuff.  Got exactly what was expected.笑
A great mom & pop run chippy 
Not as greasy as other places.
They are reasonably priced
They offer steamed fish which is a healthier option
Just keep in mind they are closed Mondays笑
I've been coming here since I was way little. It was always a must have dinner for our family when my sister and I came to Toronto to visit our grandparents. Some times we'd eat in or take it to go. The quality has never changed even though the owners have changed a few times in all my years of eating at this place. It's face service and pretty well always busy, I have never seen the place at dinner time without some kind of line. But I don't frequent as often as I'd like (trying to watch that waist line). It will always be my favourite place to get fish and chips.I have also never really found a place that compares to this one.笑
I went to Renforth F&C this week and got a snap of the family deals.  I had cod and chips for take out at home.  The piece of fish seemed smaller than I thought it should have been and usually cod comes in long pieces but it was cod, just squarish like halibut.  

After tax it was about 10 bucks.  I just thinking of what I got at Codmother in San Francisco for 10 bucks and they have officially ruined me for any other fish and chip place I think (for now).  Renforth is still ok though.
