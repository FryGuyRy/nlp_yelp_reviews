Out of date/time apple pies . Fish sandwich covered in sauce both inside the bun, outside the bun and in the box.
Not good!
Complained about cold fries they replaced them with more cold fries.笑
Tried the new and widely advertised artisan chicken sandwich.  Save your money and don't waste your time.  The chicken was paper thin and only covered about half the bun.  The tomato was thicker than the piece of chicken.

We usually only get the ice cream products for the kids, but thought I would give them chance since I haven't eaten had a McDonald's location in three plus years.  Guess I'll wait another three years......笑
I wish NO stars was a possibility. What a horrendous experience. AVOID AT ALL COSTS! Starving is better than coming here. You've been warned!
