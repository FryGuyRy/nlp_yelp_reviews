Great local place for breakfast. The staff are very good. The food was great and we got it really quickly. Lots of coffee and we never had to ask for a refill. The price was quite reasonable. It will be our go to spot.笑
Very impressed.  My office is moving to the neighbourhood and I need a decent breakfast place to meet clients. Stopped In to try the Sunbeam Grill. 
Very clean, organized and quick. I like organized. Even the drinks in the cooler were all lined up facing out.  I like it.  Everything fresh made.  

Good work. Seen you again soon.笑
I used to go into Erindale cafe regularly and was upset when it closed. I was thrilled to hear Kim and her husband opened a new location. The staff is friendly, Kim gets to know her customers and remembers what they like. It has a very personal feel. The restaurant is clean and bright. The food is always fast and reliably good. Great pancakes. They poach my eggs just right. My nieces and nephew, Abby, Mackenzie and Connor all love going there and Kim knows exactly what they like. It's nice to see personal service is still important these days.笑
Sunbeam Grill is located in a plaza off Dundas next to Home Depot. It's relatively new and I spotted it while looking for the Smitty's that I subsequently remembered had been replaced by a Sleep Country a while ago. So what's the problem with Sunbeam.

Well to start with the food is not great; at least not the Hungryman Breakfast we shared which came with 3 eggs, 2 bacon strips, sausages, peameal bacon and 2 pancakes (or French Toast). The meats appeared to be cooked a few hours earlier and warmed. The pancakes came out 5 minutes after the rest of the meal and were crispy on the outside and uncooked on the inside.

It might be best to summarize what we thought were the pros and cons:

Pros
- Good parking
- Clean new interior
- Friendly (sit-anywhere-you-want) staff
- Comfortable chairs

Cons
- Temperature drops about 20 degrees each time the outside door opens
- Food is not fresh or well cooked (at least not ours)
- The mug (for my tea) smelled like a commercial dishwasher
- Toast (which we didn't know came with the meal) was slathered in butter
- Fruit salad tasted like it was scooped with a ladle used to scoop grill food

I'm sure this place will get better in time, but right now, I imagine they are going through some start-up issues.笑
Simply amazing quality of food and service. I recommend the soup of the day because they use all fresh ingredients and flavor is outstanding  .Long story short you won't be disappointed and the owners are great people and on site helping out everyday.笑
Great food and reasonable prices. The service was good but got a bit slower as they got busier.笑
Great place for a cozy sunday brunch; ordered the chicken omlette and was far better than expected. Service was super fast (little too fast than expected) and the staff is very nice. Totally recommended.笑
Ordered the peameal eggs benedict (medium poached eggs), which was good. Wouldn't say it knocked it out of the park. Tastes like any other breakfast joint. Service was quick, and our server was friendly. The home fries aren't crispy. They're really soft...bit soggy on the inside like it was boiled.
