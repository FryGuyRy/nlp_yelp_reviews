This is a great quick and easy place to grab a falafel. Reasonable prices. Ample street parking. Friendly staff. Come here if you're unsure of where to go! The falafel salad and sandwich are great as well as the French fries and hummus.笑
Two Bald Brothers nailed it, another great food location for the downtown connoisseurs!!! The falafel wrap is SUPERB!!! 
Congratulations!!!笑
This is fairly new to the Downtown area but they have Hummus plates so I am giving it a try! OH MY GOODNESS! Fantastic Hummus with Shawarma. Big serving and fresh !! OH MY!  
I work around the corner at Container Park so this will be a regular lunch place for me. The bread is fresh as xan be and the baklava is yummy! They deliver so makes it even easier!! Can't say enough good things about here. Try it out. They are open till 8 pm so I'm sure dinner is just as great as lunch.笑
Fav new lunch spot downtown! Delicious schwarma/chicken/falafel and reasonable price point. $4 for a tub of hummus is cheaper than the grocery store and much fresher. Check it out.
