All of the good games are broken (ski ball, basketball, etc.) No air hockey table. 

They took 40 minutes to get our large pizza to our table only to be given a medium.....

There's lots of Peter pipers out there, most better then this on).笑
Worst service ever.  Tried to pick up our order that we phoned in.  Waited in the carry out line and cashier kept taking other people's orders that were eating in.  After 5 minutes we cut in and asked if we were in the right line,  as we were being ignored. She said she would be right with us.  She proceeded to ring the next 3 people up in line when I asked again if we could be helped.  She called someone to the front who proceeded to take new orders.  5 more minutes passed and I flag down another employee working behind the counter to let them know of the service and to cancel our order that has been sitting on top of the oven for the past 15 minutes.  The only thing given was a quick I'm sorry.  There are a lot of pizza places in town.  I just ordered from Dominos.  Should have done that in the first place.笑
The taste of the pizza was just mediocre. The toppings were almost non-existent. Hand-held buzzer never rang for food pickup; I went to delivery point several times to inquire. Finally about 20 minutes after ordering, a pizza matching my description was available. No one ever tried to complete the order with pizza delivery to table or call that order was ready. Staff was very nonchalant about it, which was even more annoying. There are plenty of better pizza places that actually SERVE their customers better.笑
My 3 year old loves coming here, and I actually enjoy it too. The lunch buffet is a great deal. I only wish they would play different channels on the televisions. It's always ESPN, Fox News, and Cartoon Network.  None of those are appealing to a Mom who's out with her kids. How about some HGTV or TLC?笑
Went here yesterday and had a ton of fun!!! The lunch buffet was awesome and you definitely can't beat the prices. Esteban who was working on the ticket machines, they were being funny, was AWESOME! I couldn't get the machine to cooperate and he went ahead and counted all the tickets for me. We were tired and wanted to get home. I wanna say his name was Davis, but Davis was not such a peach. I went to the counter asking him to count them since the machine wouldn't take them and he had the nastiest look on his face. Asked Esteban if they really weren't working. Are you kidding me! Esteban left the machines and did it for us. Even though he was busy trying to fix them. Took less than a minute to count them and get our prizes.  Thanks Esteban!笑
We had my daughters birthday here and we were lucky enough to have Skyler as our party host. He was the sweetest and made sure we were taken care of  all of the food came out fast and it was all delicious!! We will definitely be coming back here!笑
My first time to this location was a couple of weeks ago for a family outing.  The space is large and open, staff is friendly and helpful, and parking is plentiful and easy.  We ordered a pepperoni pizza to start and it was fine.  Nothing to rave about but it wasn't bad either.  My older child had a blast in their arcade and I found it enjoyable myself.  

After taking a short break from the arcade, I ordered their Brookie - a brownie/cookie hybrid baked dessert with a serving of vanilla ice cream.  It took 25 minutes for this single item to ready but at least it came out warm and delicious.  It's very similar to the Pizzokies or whatever you want to call them that can be found at certain chain restaurants.  If I order it again, I'll be sure to order it with all of our food and not separately like I did so I won't be stuck waiting around.

With this location being so close to home, I plan on making regular visits here to treat my children for some food and fun.笑
Was at Peter Piper Pizza for my oldest grandson's 4th birthday, it was a sat afternoon and you can tell this place makes it dough from doing kids birthday parties.  

There were enough games to entertain the little ones, my other grandson was a little moody and wanted all the tickets, so my son and I played some games to get him more tickets, and when it came to redeeming them my son was trying to tell him what he could get, but he was dead set on having this off road bike toy which was out of his ticket range, the guy behind the booth just told my grandson that he had enough tickets and the bike is his, that guy just made my lil ones day! 

This is definitely a place for kids, this isn't fancy pizza,   but the staff is friendly and helpful and the kids had a blast, and isn't that what it's all about? The kids?笑
We were planning on going to another pizza establishment, but there was a line and we didn't feel like waiting.  My father in law took me to a Peter Piper a few years ago, and surprisingly, it was decent!  I had seen this place a few times, as well as the one closer to my house in Surprise.  I remembered that they had a decent priced lunch buffet, so we decided to stop in for some grub.

First off, this Peter Piper is HUGE!  Never seen one as big in my life.  They were super busy, yet there were still tons of open places to sit and room to merge.  We decided to go with the weekday lunch buffet.  The buffet  was $6.49 and kids under 3 eat for free.  It was only $16.50 for all 3 of us to eat including one soda.  Not bad, not bad at all.  

The lunch buffet had a lot of different options.  Because they were so busy, fresh pizzas were coming out left and right.  At any given time, they had at least 10 pizzas to choose from.  They also had cheesy bread, garlic knots/rolls, a salad (didn't try any of it) as well as 2 different kinds of dessert pizza.  The pizza is not "gourmet" or anything like that, but it was surprisingly good and especially good for only $6.49.  It was way better than somewhere like Little Ceasars, Pizza Hut, Dominos etc.  It almost reminded me of the pizza I make at home.  Pretty thin crust, not too much sauce, and lots of cheese.  The best thing at the buffet had to have been the garlic knots.  These are little thumb sized balls of dough, coated in garlic oil and salt.  The outer crust of these things had a bunch of tiny bubbles on them and that provided great texture and a really good crunch while biting into them.  I was impressed!  The dessert pizzas were pretty good, too!  They had an apple cinnamon one and a strawberry type one.  The apple cinnamon was the better of the 2.  The strawberry one was a bit too sweet.

After we were done eating, we dropped a couple of bucks at the arcade type thing they have.  This part of the restaurant was actually a bit small.  They could use some extra space of the dining area to maybe expand the games?  They only had like 2 "rides" for little kids and one of them was broken.  Most of the games were ticket type games.  They did have one claw machine with those rubber spiky balls in them.  I won 2 of them for my son, Bill.  

Overall, I liked it better than I probably should have.  If I'm going out for pizza and want to spend some decent money, Peter Piper is nowhere in the equation.  If I want a cheap, fast, and unlimited buffet, Peter Piper is my place!  I can definitely see having a birthday party here or just coming back during the week on one of my days off when I don't want to drop $15.00 on a "good pizza".  The price can't be beat and the quality is not bad...even for a pizza snob like myself ;-).笑
Here for a B-Day party, very busy location, staff was attentive and kids loved the games. Its Peter Piper what more can I really say busier than most locations笑
This place is great especially for children's parties. We went there for my granddaughter's 4th birthday and a party of 10. Large, clean and well lit parking area, entrance has several wide glass doors, ordering and pick up areas easy and well defined with plenty of proficient staff, cooking area appeared clean and efficient, dining area was always kept clean and condiment tables always kept fully stocked. Lots of well maintained arcade type games as well as some rides. You can trade in your winning ticket stubs for some nice prizes at the toy store. Some TVs scattered through out the dining area. You place your order and you receive a beeper to notify you when your pizza is ready. If you have numerous pizzas for a large party the friendly staff will assist you with no hesitation. We all had a good time and the pizzas and wings were good too! BTW you can reserve a table and order in advance if you would like.  Just walk in and the party is on!
 I feel like I am doing a paid promotion for Peter Piper Pizza but I am not...this actually happened yesterday @ 6:00 pm.! Thanks Peter Piper!笑
I guess I should have known better but I gave Peter piper another try, it's been quite awhile since I've been here but the mailed coupons had me try another pizza. bad idea. Tried a large NY 3 cheese pizza and the crust tasted like cardboard and the worst pizza I've had in years, seriously I've had better frozen pizza's so I should have just gone to oreganos and paid $25 for a pizza that is edible. I Know this place is for kids but I can't believe they still serve this garbage and think it's ok, kids have taste buds too, HORRIBLE is my message for anyone reading this笑
Food was just okay, no employees were monitoring the games or rides, kids were climbing on and spinning on a ride that was broken and a teenage girl ran into my 4 yr old while running around in a circle to spin the broken ride, by this time I was extrememly angry and dragged a manager out to tape it up with caution signs, we will not go back.笑
I went to 3 Peter Piper Pizza parties last weekend (lots of bday parties this month) and this was by far the nicest one.

The staff was most helpful.  Everything we asked for we were given by our party hostess.  

The food was made fresh to order and the toppings were as expected.

The place was very busy but remarkably clean in the dining, game room, and bathrooms.  

The games were in good working order and current.  The kids had a really good time.

I would have another party here and recommend it to others.  It is better than the Metro PP I went to and blows the one on Baseline out of the water.笑
This Peter Piper has the worst customer service. We waited behind a guy and there was no one behind the register or in the back cooking only people cleaning the tables and benches. Then a lady came up to the counter and was rude to the man in front of my husband and I. Then she walked away and didn't even take our order. Then 2-3 more e employees came out of the back and after about another 2 minutes one employee asked us if we had ordered. Then he was the only employee that actually said anything to us. Not impressed will not recommend.笑
I'm a fan of PPP. Really decent pizza, run-of-the mill salads (hey, it's NOT a salad place!), and great fun for the kiddos. We went on a Saturday and let the kids run wild and mad. Had a lot of fun in the noise and chaos. Pizza was good. Staff works around the tables quickly to clean them off and get them ready for the next hungry family coming in. 
Wish they had PPP where I live. I miss them.笑
We went for the lunch buffet as my oldest son has been begging to go. It was a mad house!  There was no ice for fountain drinks, no forks, no breadsticks, hardly any pizza to choose from (due to them not keeping up with the demand), and only 1 salad to choose from. I saw many 'questionable' people loading up their plates--like 8 slices on one plate. It was so busy that they didn't even have proper plates. We ate on cheap paper plates!  We stood in line for over 10 minutes to get through the buffet line. I was still hungry after my one slice of pizza and handful of salad, but didn't want to go wait in the line again, as it was even longer. I guess it's a good diet plan.笑
Peter Piper pizza is one of my favorite pizza since I was young. The only issue today I bought $20 for 100 tokens, the register gave me 2 coins. I put 1 coin in the machine and tokens came out. I put another coin and tokens came out. I counted the coins so I can evenly distribute them to 3 kids. (2 of my sons and a friend of my son). There were only 50 coins instead of 100 that I paid for. I told a worker out front about the issue (same girl that took my order). She stated this has happened before. She went to tell her manager and came back and told me that they wouldn't give me the other 50 tokens. I told her she can have the tokens back and give me a refund. She went to talk to her manager and came back to give me 50 tokens. If this issue happened before then why did she give me trouble the first time to give me tokens I paid for. I am not trying to steal tokens and I want to get what I paid for. I am glad I got the tokens after asking for a refund. The real  issue I am not happy with is having to ask twice. I wish they can check their cameras and see what happened that I only got 50 instead of 100. This may not seem like a big issue. But customers should always get what they pay for. I do not remember the girl I talked to and it's not my job to do so. I do not want anything in return other than Peter piper pizza to improve their customer service and make sure customers get what they pay for.笑
Cheap and average food for a buffet. Need to do a better job corraling the kids, they run all over and to be honest it just seems dangerous.  I think if they could somehow block the dining side a little better it would be more condusive to a better experience.笑
Had a blast here with my wife and son. $20 in coins goes a long way.  It was the perfect place to bring my son after he went to the doctor for his check up (he had 4 shots!). 

Pizza was fantastic as always and the employees were happy to exchange my sons tickets for toys. 

5 stars for sure.笑
They have an all you can eat pizza lunch for around $6 dollars. There are several different pizzas you can choose from and a desert pizza to end your meal. 
This is not the reason we go. The pizza is OK but many places make better. We go there because we have a grandson and he likes to push the buttons on the games and win tickets. He had a great time and I love to watch him push the buttons. 
There are many reasons to go there: Party, of any kind, meeting friends with kids, family outing. Maybe you just want a piece of pizza and some time to relax in a corner. 
Another reason: I am always treated well when I go there. If I want a piece of pizza that is not on out. Just ask and they will fix you any kind they make.笑
Torn between a heavy 3 or a soft 4.  Med Rand H here for lunch.  This was definitely a lot cheerier place than the one near where I work.  The restrooms were well kept.  There were always fresh pizzas out and I saw a couple of folks ask for specific toppings and it was only a short wait.  While not a huge pizza fan there was nothing wring with any of those I sampled.  For a lunch buffet it was quite reasonably priced.笑
Still terrible service every time. Standing here waiting at the ticket counter for about 15 min and several workers have walked by and don't even say anything , just look and keep walking. There was no one here at the counter and someone just showed up finally and the line behind us is crazy now. Several games are out of order as usual. They do have about 4 new games but service is horrible as always.笑
Overall this is actually one of my top five favorite place to get a pizza, and let the kids go nuts. The only thing is that this particular Peter Piper is always over packed and just doesn't have enough games or play area for the kids.

The other thing that bothered me about this location was the RUSH job they put on us. We were there for one of my son's friends birthday party. They had a couple table reserved, as others had every other table in the place reserved, cramming us all together. The tables were clearly marked with the child's name and the time the tables were reserved for.

With about 15 minutes left for the time they had it reserved for, employees began to come over and begin cleaning up our tables as people were still eating. At the exact time the tables were to no longer be reserved for our group, we were politely asked to leave so the next group could get set up.

Not totally impressed with the packed place and rush job, but the pizza was still good. Take it for what its worth.笑
This location has an excellant manager, Janet. I was blown away by the service I recieved because a) it was a special order and b) it was to be picked up 2.5 hours BEFORE they were open. She and her staff were already in perfect uniform and  in high spirits. She had a happy smile on, and was so cheerful! I will go here more often with my son, even though I wish they had the gates like Chuck E Cheese. She made me think that if she is in such a genuinely good mood, her staff is probably top notch. A good work environment makes it easier to do you job well. I look forward to going back!笑
This location is the same like all the others.  Ordering station, tables, games section, and prizes.  Some kids I use to babysit are all teenagers now, they wanted to re-live their PPP days.  We met up there to catch up!  It was easy to find, huge parking lot, the place was not packed to the gills with kiddie birthday parties (sat afternoon), and it was clean!  The pizza tasted better than I remembered.  The wings were ok.  They had a great everyday deals on the menu.  We got the 2 large & 20 wings.  I had a great time getting caught with everyone's lifes and sharing memories.
