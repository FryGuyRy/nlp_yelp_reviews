Amazing jerk chicken, at a good price and great service. Check out their Tuesday lunch specials!笑
Best Caribbean jerk chicken in the Eglinton / Marlee area.  We have gone to several others in this area, none of which are as full of flavor.  I don't want that bland flavour, give me some punch in my chicken!  Yay Mammas!  Keep on what you're doing.笑
The food here is awesome. Leonora is such a lovely, friendly lady. I was here with 4 of my friends and we were all pleasantly happy with the food and service. If you are looking for good Jamaican food this is the place. Thank you.笑
the best spot for jerk in the city! big portions and good price. definitely worth the subway stop.笑
Really enjoyed the Fried Chicken, Curry Goat and Rice and Peas.  The food seems lovingly prepared and has a great deal of flavour. Can't go wrong with Mama's!笑
