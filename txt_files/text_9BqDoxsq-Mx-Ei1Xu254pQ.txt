First time trying this location. All pizzas and bread sticks are take and bake which make prices lower than other pizzas places. Pizzas are on a paper plate and is used one time only to bake. If you leave pizzas on plate entire baking time, the crust is rubber like. You will need to slide off pizzas onto a rack or stone during cooking to obtain a crunch like crust. The sauce is some what spicy and breadsticks do not have much flavor. If you are serious about pizzas and their taste, this place may not do.笑
Just tried this place - thought it might be a hokey premise but man, is it good! Basically, they make fresh pizza in front of you and you cook it at home. We had a pepperoni and the med special (spinach/feta/chicken/sun dried tomato). 

The appeal is really that the pizza gets done how you want it - crispy, soft crust whatever. . .our whole family loved it! I was pleasantly surprised how easy it was to bake and the price is reasonable.

Finally, the owners are really eager to please and were very good about explaining the concept and how to cook them. 

Thumbs up!笑
Outstanding value, taste, freshness, and service. Ordered Chicken Bacon Artichoke deLITE and Herb Chicken Mediterranean deLITE - DELICIOUS.
