Great food. Great price and very fast. No frills Vietnamese food that is fresh and good.笑
Food is very good, quick and friendly serving. Cleanliness is a bit of an issue at the bathrooms..笑
Under new management not what it used to be the food isn't as good. They cater not to Asian community because we know what authentic taste like ..... The seating arrangement there's plenty and its clean. The pho was not up to par with the other places I have been to and the rice dishes were overpriced ... Everything here is overpriced would not come again ...
