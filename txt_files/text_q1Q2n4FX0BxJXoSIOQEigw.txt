The worst service ever. 25 min to get one order and two people working...lazy ass people... I work for a living and so should they. But apparently not in this case.笑
Let me say this - if you're claiming to be "The Great Steak & Potato Co.," you'd better make a mean potato! Stopped here on a road trip, and I'm sad to say that Wendy's makes a better potato than these hacks. Seriously... they stuck a spud in the microwave and poured Velveta on it! It was shriveled and sad. Are you kidding me? No thanks.笑
Give yourself extra time for your food. Tasted okay, but the service was horrible. They showed no interest in taking or completing orders.笑
Located at the Vermillion Valley Travel Plaza in the food court.

I ordered a loaded baked potato and thought, this is gonna be good!

I opted for the steak with melted cheese.  They served it in a black plastic take-out container with clear lid.  Lemonade was the drink of choice.

The steak was more like sliced roast beef, and the cheese was the kind you get out of a machine to put on top of chili or a Coney Dog.

Still, it was great tasting and a welcome change from the usual fast food offerings.笑
Laziest employees on the planet! They actually closed with people in line!  People in line waiting as an order was processed and when the order was finished the employee told the rest of the people in line that they were closed at 7:59 on 12/12/15!
