It is what it is. In a pinch, they are better than most QST. I still love IN N OUT...

There is a torn up street between my shop and the Jack in the Box I normally go to grab a quick burger so I ventured across Grand to this location.  Newer store that looks like it has had a complete remodel of the dining room.  I don't recall seeing hi-tops at Jacks before.  The store wasn't real busy, it was only just after 11,  and the manager came out and chatted with me while I was waiting for my order and she was cleaning the soda fountain dispensers.  While I always get take out at the one near me I would consider eating in at this one.  The whole atmosphere it different.

The ultimate cheeseburger, bacon/cheese potato wedges and the cheesecake were all as expected.笑
nasty - gross   all tables were dirty, no one around to even ask them to wipe them off!!!    stood at counter way too long ---no one ever came to take my order, people waiting everywhere.  workers behind counter, in the back?????   walked out.  i am surprised that people even go to this jack in the box.  what a disappointment!
