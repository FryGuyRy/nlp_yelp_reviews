10pm on a Friday night.  Wanted a hassle free french dip sandwich.  Tried Subway substitute steak sandwich.  Horrible.  How can they call it meat let alone steak?笑
In a busy strip mall location and not the easiest in & out there is. Staff was friendly and my order was correct. Restaurant was clean and stocked. Average location overall.笑
I was out with a customer and we only had about 40 minutes to eat lunch so he suggested Subway.  They were a little backed up as the rest of the lunch crew wasn't due in yet but it didn't take too long.  I had a 12" chicken bacon melt and it tasted pretty good.They didn't mind us moving tables around fro a group of 5.  The place was clean.  As we got closer to noon the line really grew.笑
We had the great pleasure of meeting Ron at this location. He saved the reputation of this place. We'd been here before and the service was not anything to write home about. Ron was caring, down to earth and made our day brighter. He was all smiles and our orders were made to perfection! We LOVED him! If you'd had horrible service here before, go back when Ron is working and you will wonder why he wasn't there the many times before! We love you Ron and your sandwhiches were phenomenal! We will certainly be letting corporate know how valuable you are to this brand and location! 15/10 on delightful, professional and perfection of customer service!笑
Love this place, great customer service right when I walk in the door, very helpful with suggestions ect will come back time and time again!!笑
Friendly staff. Always welcomed and service is always great. Never too busy and when it is lunch time staff does a good job of moving people along.
