Really great place to grab a bite. Nice warm and cozy. Good place to get into intimate with someone.笑
Simply the best sweet potato fries I ever had!
Great tuna melt (panini).  Would def go again.笑
Good fresh ingredients. Reasonably prompt service. I enjoyed the sweet potato fries but a friend thought they were too salty. I had the Cabana panini and particularly enjoyed the tomato relish. The pastries look delicious but they'll have to wait for another visit.  Would definitely return.笑
If you like bugs  in your  salad then go ahead & eat here. Manager didn't even care or seemed surprised when it was given returned. Just straight  nasty. Go eat somewhere else. Don't let it fool you.笑
Cute place!
Fresh cookies cakes and other baked goods!
Good place for a quick yet delicious lunch!
They cater too!
