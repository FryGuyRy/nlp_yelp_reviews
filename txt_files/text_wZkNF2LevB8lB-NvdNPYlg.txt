For airport Chinese, those was surprisingly good.  I had vegetables with spivey noodles and, with a bottle of water, it cost $6.73.  You can't buy a magazine in an airport for that cheap.  Not greasy, not overly browned like most chain Chinese, relatively fresh, nicely spiced noodles.  And nice people working there.  It's all relative in an airport, and, in that context, this was great.笑
Perhaps worst Chinese
In the genre's history.
Avoid at all costs.笑
Fresh sushi from a nice fella that works there. Best airport sushi I've had! Didn't try the hot bar though.笑
Good and cheap for on the go Chinese food. Polite workers. Nice find. I got one entree meal combo (General Tso chicken w fried rice & hot sour soup) with soda for under $10.笑
I asked them if I could sample the chicken and the lady said no. Walked over to next door and she didn't stop me so I thought they were confident about their own quality. So I ordered the rice noodles, bourbon chicken and pepper chicken. Only the pepper chicken was edible barely although hardly any chicken pieces. 

Noodles extremely dry and bland, bourbon chicken might have had spoiled meat. Learned my lesson. If a place like this doesn't allow sampling (as is standard for this type of Chinese place) run away!!笑
Quick, tasty, and fresh. Nice, friendly employees. 

I just got a 1 item combo to go. The veggies were very fresh and al dente, just the way I like them.

The nice thing was that the food looked as if it wasn't sitting around all day, which is how I usually see these Asian airport places.

I'd eat here again. Not bad prices, either.

Enjoy!
