DELICIOUS!  The decor is very basic here but the food and friendliness of the staff surely made up for it.  The pescado a lo macho was divine.  The Sudado de Pescado was also very good if you want a lighter, healthier meal.  The calamari appetizer was light and fresh.  Getting the food once ordered way a bit slow thus the four stars.  Waaaaay better restaurant than El Fogon.笑
Great Peruvian restaurant! Very good tamales and the empanadas are just like if they were made in Peru! I have been here for breakfast and another time for lunch. Wasn't disappointed in any of them笑
Great peruvian authentic food at a fair price. Neighborhood is not the best but there is a supermarket nearby where you can park. Just walk a couple of blocks and you are there. Good service. I highly recommend it笑
Excellent food and great service! Looking forward to coming back! Highly recommend hitting up this new Peruvian restaurant! :)笑
I promise you, come to this restaurant and try their ceviche and the calamari. It is the best ceviche I have had since being in Peru. When you sit down people come into the restaurant saying hello in Spanish, you can hear Spanish music coming from the kitchen with every flavourfull bite you take. Not a fancy restaurant, but it is authentic and please try the ceviche. You won't be disappointed.
