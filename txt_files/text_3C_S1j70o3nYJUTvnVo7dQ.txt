This has got to be the friendliest Arby's I have ever seen. It's got that nice, small hometown customer service style to it. Like most Arby's, coupons can be reused infinitely which is pretty cool.笑
DO NOT GO TO THIS ARBYS! My dad works on soda machines for pepsi. the complaint was black particles in the water,so he takes of the cover and theres cockroaches! and the black particles... were crap! this place is gross af笑
This location is somewhat difficult to get in and out of based solely on its location near a busy street. The inside is huge and usually really clean, you can tell they actually care about getting your order right or fixing any issues you have, customer service is very important to them. Service is quick and nice, food was super good. Your basic fast food location, I will eat here again for sure.笑
Great drive up service,the gentleman actually counted back my change,with a smile.You just don't get that in fast food any more.笑
Expect to be in the drive through for quite a while (20 min for us). Came through right after work around five. Ordered for my whole family and when I came home the order wasn't correct,  even though the receipt was correct. Very disappointed since we don't get to go food often and the fact that it's so expensive.笑
The worst service. Living up to the first part of her name. And no napkins; this is my biggest pet peeve with drive throughs. No common sense!
